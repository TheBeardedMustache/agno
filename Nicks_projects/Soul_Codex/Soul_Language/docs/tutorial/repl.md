# REPL Guide

This tutorial demonstrates the interactive `sqly` shell. Run the command and type a query to see the encoded SIL frames:

```bash
sqly
```

```text
Â» GLYPH #signal-demo
```

The REPL prints a summary followed by a hex dump preview and decoded context for each frame. Toggle mirror mode or change the energy budget with the commands:

```text
:mirror on
:budget HIGH
```

Below is a short recording showing the REPL in action:
