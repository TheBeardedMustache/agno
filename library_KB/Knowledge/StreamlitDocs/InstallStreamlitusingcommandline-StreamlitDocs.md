Install Streamlit using command line
====================================

This page will walk you through creating an environment with `venv` and installing Streamlit with `pip`. These are our recommended tools, but if you are familiar with others you can use your favorite ones too. At the end, you'll build a simple "Hello world" app and run it. If you prefer to have a graphical interface to manage your Python environments, check out how to [Install Streamlit using Anaconda Distribution](/get-started/installation/anaconda-distribution).

Prerequisites
-------------

As with any programming tool, in order to install Streamlit you first need to make sure your
computer is properly set up. More specifically, you’ll need:

1. **Python**

   We support [version 3.9 to 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **A Python environment manager** (recommended)

   Environment managers create virtual environments to isolate Python package installations between
   projects.

   We recommend using virtual environments because installing or upgrading a Python package may
   cause unintentional effects on another package. For a detailed introduction to Python
   environments, check out
   [Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

   For this guide, we'll be using `venv`, which comes with Python.
3. **A Python package manager**

   Package managers handle installing each of your Python packages, including Streamlit.

   For this guide, we'll be using `pip`, which comes with Python.
4. **Only on MacOS: Xcode command line tools**

   Download Xcode command line tools using [these instructions](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/4.html)
   in order to let the package manager install some of Streamlit's dependencies.
5. **A code editor**

   Our favorite editor is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), which is also what we use in
   all our tutorials.

Create an environment using `venv`
----------------------------------

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder.

   `cd myproject`
2. In your terminal, type:

   `python -m venv .venv`
3. A folder named ".venv" will appear in your project. This directory is where your virtual environment and its dependencies are installed.

Activate your environment
-------------------------

4. In your terminal, activate your environment with one of the following commands, depending on your operating system.

   `# Windows command prompt
   .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   # Windows PowerShell
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # macOS and Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate`
5. Once activated, you will see your environment name in parentheses before your prompt. "(.venv)"

Install Streamlit in your environment
-------------------------------------

6. In the terminal with your environment activated, type:

   `pip install streamlit`
7. Test that the installation worked by launching the Streamlit Hello example app:

   `streamlit hello`

   If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:

   `python -m streamlit hello`
8. Streamlit's Hello app should appear in a new tab in your web browser!

9. Close your terminal when you are done.

Create a "Hello World" app and run it
-------------------------------------

10. Create a file named `app.py` in your project folder.

`import streamlit as st
st.write("Hello world")`

11. Any time you want to use your new environment, you first need to go to your project folder (where the `.venv` directory lives) and run the command to activate it:

`# Windows command prompt
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS and Linux
source .venv/bin/activate`

12. Once activated, you will see your environment's name in parentheses at the beginning of your terminal prompt. "(.venv)"
13. Run your Streamlit app.

`streamlit run app.py`

If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:

`python -m streamlit run app.py`

14. To stop the Streamlit server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
15. When you're done using this environment, return to your normal shell by typing:

`deactivate`
