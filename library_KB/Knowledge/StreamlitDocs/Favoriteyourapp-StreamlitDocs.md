Favorite your app
=================

Streamlit Community Cloud supports a "favorite" feature that lets you quickly access your apps from your workspace. Favorited apps appear at the top of their workspace with a yellow star (*star*) beside them. You can favorite and unfavorite apps in any workspace to which you have access as a developer or invited viewer.

#### Note

Favorites are specific to your account. Other members of your workspace cannot see which apps you have favorited.

Favoriting and unfavoriting your app
------------------------------------

You can favorite your app:

* [From your workspace](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/favorite-your-app#favorite-your-app-from-your-workspace).
* [From your app](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/favorite-your-app#favorite-your-app-from-your-app-toolbar)!

### Favorite your app from your workspace

1. From your workspace at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io), hover over your app.

   If your app is not yet favorited, a star outline (*star\_border*) will appear on hover.
2. Click on the star (*star\_border*/*star*) next to your app name to toggle its favorited status.

### Favorite your app from your app toolbar

From your app at `<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app`, click the star (*star\_border*/*star*) in the upper-right corner to toggle your app's favorited status.
