-------------

* 🔒 Developers can access secrets via attribute notation (e.g. `st.secrets.key` vs `st.secrets["key"]`) just like session state.
* ✍️ Publish type annotations according to [PEP 561](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installed_packages.html). Users now get type annotations for Streamlit when running mypy ([#4025](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/4025)).

Version 1.1.0
-------------

*Release date: Oct 21, 2021*

**Highlights**

* 🧠 Memory improvements: Streamlit apps allocate way less memory over time now.

**Notable Changes**

* ♻️ Apps automatically rerun now when the content of `secrets.toml` changes (before this you had to refresh the page manually).

* 🔗 Redirected some links to our [brand-new docs site](https://docs.streamlit.io/), e.g. in exceptions.
* 🪲 Bug fix: Allow initialization of range slider with session state ([#3586](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3586)).

Version 1.0.0
-------------

*Release date: Oct 5, 2021*

**Highlights**

* 🎈Announcing Streamlit 1.0! To read more about check out our [1.0 blog post](https://blog.streamlit.io/announcing-streamlit-1-0/).

**Other Changes**

* 🐞 Fixed an issue where using `df.dtypes` to show datatypes for a DF fails while using Arrow ([#3709](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3709)), Image captions stay within image width and are readable ([#3530](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3530)).

Version 0.89.0
--------------

*Release date: Sep 22, 2021*

**Highlights**

* 💰 Introducing `st.experimental_memo` and `experimental_singleton`, a new primitive for caching! See [our blog post](https://blog.streamlit.io/new-experimental-primitives-for-caching/).
* 🍔 Streamlit allows developers to configure their hamburger menu to be more user-centric.

**Notable Changes**

* 💅 We updated our UI to a more polished look with a new font.
* 🎨 We now support `theme.base` in the theme object when it's sent to custom components.
* 🧠 We've modified session state to reset widgets if any of their arguments changed even if they provide a key.
  + Some widget behavior may have changed, but we believe this change makes the most sense. We have added a section to [our documentation](/develop/concepts/widget-semantics) describing how they behave.

**Other Changes**

* 🐞 Bug fixes: Support svgs from a URL ([#3809](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3809)) and that do not start with `<svg>` tag ([#3789](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3789)).

**Highlights**

* ⬇️ Introducing `st.download_button`, a new button widget for easily downloading files.

**Notable Changes**

* 🛑 We made changes to improve the redacted exception experience on Streamlit Community Cloud. When `client.showErrorDetails=true` exceptions display the Error Type and the Traceback, but redact the actual error text to prevent data leaks.

Version 0.87.0
--------------

*Release date: Aug 19, 2021*

**Highlights**

* 🔢 Introducing `st.metric`, an API for displaying KPIs. Check out the [demo app](https://streamlit-release-demos-0-87streamlit-app-0-87-rfzphf.streamlit.app/) showcasing the functionality.

Version 0.86.0
--------------

*Release date: Aug 5, 2021*

**Highlights**

* 🎓 Our layout primitives are graduating from beta! You can now use `st.columns`, `st.container` and `st.expander` without the `beta_` prefix.

**Notable Changes**

* 📱 When using `st.columns`, columns will stack vertically when viewport size <640px so that column layout on smaller viewports is consistent and cleaner. ([#3594](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3594)).

**Other Changes**

* 🐞 **Bug fixes**: Fixed `st.date_input` crashes if its empty ([#3194](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3194)), Opening files with utf-8([#3022](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3022)), `st.select_slider` resets its state upon interaction ([#3600](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3600)).

  + (Users who wish to continue using the legacy data frame serialization can do so by setting the `dataFrameSerialization` config option to `"legacy"` in their `config.toml`).

**Notable Changes**

* 🪄 `st.text_input` now has an `autocomplete` parameter to allow password managers to be used

**Other Changes**

* Using st.set\_page\_config to assign the page title no longer appends "Streamlit" to that title ([#3467](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3467))

* [`st.image`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.76.0/api.html#streamlit.image)'s `use_column_width` now defaults to an `auto` option which will resize the image to the column width if the image exceeds the column width.
* ✂️ Fixed bugs ([2437](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2437) and [2247](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2247)) with content getting cut off within a [`st.beta_expander`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.76.0/api.html#streamlit.beta_expander)
* 📜 Fixed a [bug](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2543) in [`st.dataframe`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.76.0/api.html#streamlit.dataframe) where the scrollbar overlapped with the contents in the last column.
* 💾 Fixed a [bug](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2561) for [`st.file_uploader`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.76.0/api.html#streamlit.file_uploader) where file data returned was not the most recently uploaded file.
* ➕ Fixed bugs ([2086](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2086) and [2556](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2556)) where some LaTeX commands were not rendering correctly.

  now been increased to provide a better visual experience.

Version 0.74.0
--------------

*Release date: January 6, 2021*

**Notable Changes**

* 💾 [`st.file_uploader`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.74.0/api.html#streamlit.file_uploader). has been stabilized and the deprecation warning
  and associated configuration option (`deprecation.showfileUploaderEncoding`) has been removed.
* 📊 [`st.bokeh_chart`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.74.0/api.html#streamlit.bokeh_chart) is no longer duplicated when the page loads.
