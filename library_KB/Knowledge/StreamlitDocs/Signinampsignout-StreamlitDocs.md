#### Important

When you sign in with GitHub, Community Cloud will look for an account that uses the same email you have on your GitHub account. If such an account doesn't exist, Community Cloud will look for an account that uses your GitHub account for source control. In this latter instance, Community Cloud will update the email on your Community Cloud account to match the email on your GitHub account.

Sign in with Email
------------------

1. Click "**Continue to sign-in**."
2. In the "Email" field, enter your email address.
3. Click "**Continue**." (If prompted, verify you are human.)
4. Go to your email inbox, and copy your one-time, six-digit code. The code is valid for ten minutes.
5. Return to the authentication page, and enter your code. (If prompted, verify you are human.)

If your account is already linked to GitHub, you may be immediately prompted to sign in with GitHub.

Sign out of your account
------------------------

From your workspace, click on your workspace name in the upper-left corner. Click "**Sign out**."
