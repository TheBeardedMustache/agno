[*bolt*](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit)

[Streamlit in Snowflake.](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit) Run your Streamlit app as a native object in Snowflake. Enjoy an in-browser editor and minimal work to configure your environment. Share your app with other users in your Snowflake account through role-based access control (RBAC). This is a great way to deploy apps internally for your business. Check out Snowflake docs!

[*ac\_unit*](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/adding-streamlit)

[Snowflake Native Apps.](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/adding-streamlit) Package your app with data and share it with other Snowflake accounts. This is a great way to share apps and their underlying data with other organizations who use Snowflake. Check out Snowflake docs!

[*web\_asset*](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview)

[Snowpark Container Services.](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) Deploy your app in a container that's optimized to run in Snowflake. This is the most flexible option, where you can use any library and assign a public URL to your app. Manage your allowed viewers through your Snowflake account. Check out Snowflake docs!

#### Note

Using Snowpark Container Services to deploy a Streamlit app requires a compute pool, which is not available in a trial account at this time.
