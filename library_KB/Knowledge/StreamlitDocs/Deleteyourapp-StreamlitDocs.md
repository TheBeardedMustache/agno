Delete your app
===============

If you need to delete your app, it's simple and easy. There are several cases where you may need to delete your app:

* You have finished playing around with an example app.
* You want to deploy from a private repository but already have a private app.
* You want to [change the Python version](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/upgrade-python) for your app.
* You want to [rename your repository](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/rename-your-app) or move your entrypoint file.

If you delete your app and intend to immediately redploy it, your custom subdomain should be immediately available for reuse. Read more about data deletion in [Streamlit trust and security](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/trust-and-security#data-deletion).

You can delete your app:

* [From your workspace](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/delete-your-app#delete-your-app-from-your-workspace).
* [From your Cloud logs](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/delete-your-app#delete-your-app-from-your-cloud-logs).
