Agent Teams [Deprecated]
========================

Agent Teams were an initial implementation of our multi-agent architecture (2023-2025) that use a transfer/handoff mechanism. After 2 years of experimentation, we’ve learned that this mechanism is not scalable and do NOT recommend it for complex multi-agent systems.

Please use the new [Teams](/teams) architecture instead.

We can combine multiple Agents to form a team and tackle tasks as a cohesive unit. Here’s a simple example that converts an agent into a team to write an article about the top stories on hackernews.

hackernews\_team.py
